"""
As we know the concept of OOP revolves around 'objects' and to create an object we need class fo that object
As the class works as the frame for any object. Using a class we can create any number of objects of that class
which all have same properties(i.e attributes or variables) and behaviours(i.e operations or methods),
However properties values can be different based on the parameters we pass in the constructor function.
In Python, a class constructor is a special member function of that class, that is executed whenever
we create a new object of that class.In python we define constructor function using built-in "__init__()" method.
In Python, class constructors doesn't return anything and every class constructor must have at least one argument 'self'
which represents current instance of the class or the current object and apart from that
it can have other arguments also, which are basically used to set the initial value of properties(attributes)
of that object while creating the object.
